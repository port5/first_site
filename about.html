<p>
If she is not in the {virtual} office, Tanczer is trying to attend as many meetups, conferences and <a href="https://www.cryptoparty.in/">CryptoParties</a> as possible, trawls through the Internet for new cat videos, or posts tech or feminist-related articles on <a href="https://twitter.com/leotanczt">Twitter</a>. Oh, and she takes pride in her Erdős number, which is 5.
