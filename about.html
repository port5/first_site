I am a PhD Student at the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofPoliticsInternationalStudiesandPhilosophy/">School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy</a> at Queen's University Belfast and former Fellow at the <a href="http://www.hiig.de/en/">Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society</a> in Berlin. I studied Political Science (B.A.) at the University Vienna and University of Limerick (Republic of Ireland) and Political Psychology (MSc.) at the Queen's University Belfast. I am currently working on her interdisciplinary PhD project "Emerging Security Governance in the Cyber Domain: Technology, Politics, and Rights in Practice". The thesis investigates the emerging discussions and policy implementations around the issue of hacking and hacktivism, looking closely at the possibility to re-articulate political rights online.
