My current research focuses on Internet security. I am working an inter-disciplinary PhD project with the title "Emerging Security Governance in the Cyber Domain: Technology, Politics, and Rights in Practice". In the course of this, I am merging Critical Security Studies theory with the digital realm. My research examines the (in)securitisation of <strong>hacking and hacktivism</strong>. The emphasis lies on the European Union. The PhD thesis investigates the sphere of politics and bureaucracy, the industrial cybersecurity sector as well as self-identified hackers and hacktivists. 

<p>
In doing so, I am hoping to study distinct perceptions on hacking and hacktivism and identify (in)security discourses and practices within the governmental, corporate as well as civil society level. The PhD research is comparing these varying perspectives and determines how these viewpoints  contradict or overlap. The thesis should give an insight into the social construction of security risks and (in)security practices. It should further foster a more critical engagement with the framing of security threats and the ongoing cybersecurity developments in general.

Some of my prior research projects included studies on the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2767393">Pirate Party of Austria</a>, <a href="http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/01/12/1461444814567983.abstract">gender stereotypes</a> within the hacktivist community, and <a href="http://publikationen.collaboratory.at/mri/post-gender-internet/">sexism online</a>. Hence, I am interested in these intersection points of gender, technology and security. Besides my current focus on cybersecurity, additional research interests include among others, Gender Studies, (Online) Collective Action and Internet Governance. Please consult my <a href="publications.html">list of publications</a> for further details on my scholarly work.
