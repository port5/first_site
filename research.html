My research focuses on Internet security and is currently concentrating on its interconnection with the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (IoT). I am researcher for the <a href="https://www.petrashub.org/">PETRAS IoT Hub</a>, a consortium of nine UK universities, where I am part of its "Standards, Governance and Policy" Stream. My work explores issues such as the regulation and standardisation of IoT devices. I am specifically interested in questions of the control of personal data, informed consent, and responsible disclosure. I am also dipping my toe into new waters such as cyber insurance and security training/education.  
	
<p>	
I have previously submitted my inter-disciplinary PhD project with the title "Hacking (In)Security: Discourses and Practices of Politics, Technology and Activism". In the course of my thesis, I merged Critical Security Studies theory with the digital realm. My research examined the (in)securitisation of <strong>hacking and hacktivism</strong>. The emphasis lied on the European Union. The PhD project investigated the sphere of politics and bureaucracy, the industrial cybersecurity sector and self-identified hackers and hacktivists.
</p>
	
<p>
In doing so, I studied distinct perceptions on hacking and hacktivism and identified (in)security discourses and practices within the governmental, corporate as well as civil society level. The PhD research compared these varying perspectives and determines how these viewpoints contradict or overlap. The thesis gives an insight into the social construction of security risks and (in)security practices. It further fosters a more critical engagement with the framing of security threats and the ongoing cybersecurity developments in general.

Some of my prior research projects included studies on the <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2767393">Pirate Party of Austria</a>, <a href="http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/01/12/1461444814567983.abstract">gender stereotypes</a> within the hacktivist community, and <a href="http://publikationen.collaboratory.at/mri/post-gender-internet/">sexism online</a>. I am consequently interested in these intersection points of gender, technology and security. I also developed a passion for the analysis of <a href="http://jogss.oxfordjournals.org/content/jogss/1/4/346.full.pdf">censorship and surveillance</a> and am outspoken about security issues within <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2016/dec/01/the-snoopers-charter-is-a-threat-to-academic-freedom">academia</a>. Additional research interests include, among others, Gender Studies, (Online) Collective Action, and Internet Governance. Please consult my <a href="publications.html">list of publications</a> for further details on my scholarly work.
