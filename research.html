My present research focuses on hacking and hacktivism and examines how these issues have become seen as a security issue and are now rendered as significant security threat to society. In the course of my PhD I am consequently studying the sphere of politics, industry and self-identified hackers and hacktivist. I am comparing their perspective on cybersecurity and looking at the ways these might overlap and contradict. The research should help to give an insight in the social construction of security risks and help to foster a more critical engagement with framing of security risks and online security in general.

Some of my prior research projects have included studies on the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofPoliticsInternationalStudiesandPhilosophy/FileStore/Studentfiles/Filetoupload,448034,en.pdf">Pirate Party of Austria</a>, <a href="http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/01/12/1461444814567983.abstract">gender stereotypes</a> within the hacktivist community, and <a href="http://publikationen.collaboratory.at/mri/post-gender-internet/">sexism online</a>. Besides my focus on hacking and hacktivism further research interests include therefore, among others, Gender Studies, Online Collective Action, Internet Governance, and Science and Technology Studies. I am always interested in collaborating with other researchers who work on simliar research fields and am looking forward to hear from scholars who work on these intersection points.
