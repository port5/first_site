I am always happy to hear about researchers working on similar topics and may be approached for collaborative projects or feedback. I am also available for <strong>public lectures, speeches or keynotes</strong> as well as <strong>academic skills</strong> trainings. 

<p>
Besides, I am open to provide <strong>consultancy</strong> to individuals, teams and organisations  on either a one-off or an ongoing basis. If you want to inquire about my availability or would like to discuss working together, please write me an email.

<p> 
Lastly, if you would like to hear more about my thoughts, daily rants and ideas, feel free to follow me on Social Media. I am an active <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/leotanczt">Twitter</a></strong> user, where I regularily post about issues such as cybersecurity, politics and feminism.
